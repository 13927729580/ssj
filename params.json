{"name":"SSJ","tagline":"Realtime Social Signal Processing for Java/Android","body":"![Logo](/assets/logo_w100.png) \r\n### Realtime Social Signal Processing for Java/Android\r\n\r\nAuthors: Ionut Damian, Michael Dietz, Frank Gaibler, Daniel Langerenken\r\n\r\nThe Social Signal Interpretation for Java (SSJ) framework is beeing developed at the Lab for Human Centered Multimedia of the University of Augsburg.\r\nSSJ has been inspired by the SSI (http://openssi.net) framework. SSJ is not a one-to-one port of SSI to Java, it is an approximation. Nor does SSJ pretend to offer SSI's comprehensive functionality and performance (this is java after all). Nevertheless, SSJ borrows a lot of programming patterns from SSI and preserves the same vision for signal processing which makes SSI great. It than packages everything in a flexible, mobile friendly Java library which can be easily integrated into Android Apps.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n* Realtime signal processing using independent components as processing steps in a pipeline\r\n* Synchornized data streams\r\n* Support for most standard android sensors (Camera, Microphone, Acceleration, ...)\r\n* Support for external sensors via bluetooth (e.g. Myo, Empatica)\r\n* I/O functionality: local storage, sockets, bluetooth\r\n* Basic GUI elements: graphs (using [GraphView](https://github.com/hcmlab/GraphView) library), camera painter\r\n\r\n### License\r\nThis library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 3 of the License, or any later version.\r\n\r\nThis library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
