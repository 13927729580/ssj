  ~ This file is part of the Social Signal Interpretation for Java (SSJ) framework
  ~ developed at the Lab for Human Centered Multimedia of the University of Augsburg.
  ~
  ~ SSJ has been inspired by the SSI (http://openssi.net) framework. SSJ is not a
  ~ one-to-one port of SSI to Java, it is an approximation. Nor does SSJ pretend
  ~ to offer SSI's comprehensive functionality and performance (this is java after all).
  ~ Nevertheless, SSJ borrows a lot of programming patterns from SSI.
