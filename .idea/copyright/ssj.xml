SSJ is not a&#10;one-to-one port of SSI to Java, it is an approximation. Nor does SSJ pretend&#10;to offer SSI's comprehensive functionality and performance (this is java after all).&#10;Nevertheless, SSJ borrows a lot of programming patterns from SSI.&#10;&#10;This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the&#10;terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software&#10;Foundation; either version 3 of the License, or any later version.&#10;&#10;This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT&#10;ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS&#10;FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&#10;See the GNU General Public License for more details.&#10;&#10;You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along&#10;with this library; if not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;." />
