### Realtime Social Signal Processing for Java/Android

Authors: Ionut Damian, Michael Dietz, Frank Gaibler, Daniel Langerenken

The Social Signal Interpretation for Java (SSJ) framework is beeing developed at the Lab for Human Centered Multimedia of the University of Augsburg.
SSJ has been inspired by the SSI (http://openssi.net) framework. SSJ is not a one-to-one port of SSI to Java, it is an approximation. Nor does SSJ pretend to offer SSI's comprehensive functionality and performance (this is java after all). Nevertheless, SSJ borrows a lot of programming patterns from SSI and preserves the same vision for signal processing which makes SSI great. It than packages everything in a flexible, mobile friendly Java library which can be easily integrated into Android Apps.

### Features
* Realtime signal processing using independent components as processing steps in a pipeline
* Synchornized data streams
* Support for most standard android sensors (Camera, Microphone, Acceleration, ...)
* Support for external sensors via bluetooth (e.g. Myo, Empatica)
* I/O functionality: local storage, sockets, bluetooth
* Basic GUI elements: graphs (using [GraphView](https://github.com/jjoe64/GraphView) library), camera painter
